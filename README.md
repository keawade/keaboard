A split ergo 4x6 keyboard designed by Keith Wade.

![WIP](./WIP_2020-08-18%2007-08-13.png)

Designed for use with the [nice!nano][nicenano] USB-C Bluetooth Pro Micro replacement
but should work with Pro Micros or Elite-Cs.

Inspired by the [ErgoTravel][ergotravel] keyboard designed by @jpconstantineau.

## Todo

* Add reset switch
* Add power switch
* Connect matrix to controller pins
* Design plates
* Probably redesign in KiCAD
