## Todo

- Add power switch
- Design plates
- Add screw holes for attaching plates
- Clean up project directory

## Questions

- Does power switch need to be in-line of the power input?
  - If so, should it be on B+ or B-?
  - If not, what pins do I connect with the power switch?
- Are my traces done correctly? I think I need to put one set of the matrix on another
  copper layer.

## Potential Future Revisions

- Choc hotswap
- RGB underglow
- LED backlight
- RGB backlight
